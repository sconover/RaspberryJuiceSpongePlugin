# Once a single server tick takes more than a given amount of time, the watchdog will consider
# the server crashed and forcefully shut it down. When working with breakpoints or executing code
# step by step this might occur, so it is recommended that you edit your test environments
# server.properties file and set the value of max-tick-time to either a very large number (the
# amount of milliseconds a tick may take) or -1 (to disable the Watchdog completely).
